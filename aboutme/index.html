        <h2>Isaac Gutierrez S.</h2>
        <p>I'm from and live in Guayaquil, Ecuador. I have two years of marriage with a beautiful girl,</p>
        <p>as you can see in the picture we have two beautiful and crazy dogs that brighten our days.</p>
        <p>My favorite hobbies are playing the guitar, playing soccer, and playing videogames, I love to travel </p>
        <p>inside of my country or outside of my country.</p>

        <p>I love so much the world of programming and computers, so I always want to know</p>
        <p>about the new technologies and I'm curious to learn more about this. I'm a business and computer</p>
        <p>student, I think that these two careers go hand in hand. I hope to learn from every one of us and especially </p>
        <p>of our professor. I am so excited about this semester and the new things that I will learn.</p>
