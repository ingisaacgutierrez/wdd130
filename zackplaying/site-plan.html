      <p><strong>The best Headphones for you live Streams with Nintnedo Switch</strong> The SteelSeries Artiocs 7 are the best headphones for you and your streams. The best accessory of these headphones is the Arctic's transmitter because this has one audio input and output that allow you to connect the audio of your headphone connect with the Nintendo Switch this allows you to keep the chat voice active in the Nintendo Switch and that the voice of your friends can listen in the live stream too. The big problem that we had with the players of the Nintendo is that the captures of the video that we use to share our games on the screen don't allow us to share the audio of our friends in the olive stream but these headphones allow us to share theses. Now with this accessory, the people in our chat will understand and smile with us in the stream. </p>
